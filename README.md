This project uses the basic pitch function to play notes.
In the main loop function below, we can choose the key behaviour you want by changing the unannotated function.
You can also write your own if you understand basic programming!
The project uses the function tone to generate sounds,
using the pitches.h library to define the frequencies of the different notes.
The code also includes a function called readCapacitivePin to measure the capacitance on the pins.
